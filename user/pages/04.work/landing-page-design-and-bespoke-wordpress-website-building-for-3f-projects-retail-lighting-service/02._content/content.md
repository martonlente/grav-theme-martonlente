3F Project is a company providing light and lighting effects design services for living. They hired me to design their shop retail lighting service's landing page, and build in WordPress. I used their logo and graphic standards manual as a starting point, and developed an elegantly simple visual look, with the use of dark and light tones, and strong typography. Using a WordPress page builder plugin, and only a sparing use of custom code enabled me to pixel-perfectly build the simple website, saving both cost and time.
