STUDIO IN-EX Zrt. is an international architecture, and engineering company with more than 150 employees in Hungary, and Hong Kong. After I completed the company's rebranding, they hired me to design and develop their new business website, and career portal, to help HR department in intensive recruitment. In strong cooperation with IN-EX's leaders, HR department and Vidu Media I designed and developed their business website that tells what they do, and career portal, that works both as an employer branding and job application platform. Developing with Perch CMS helped me building a custom web portal, that is pleasing for the visitors, and is easy to manage for the company's content managers and HR department.
