After I completed the company''s rebranding, they hired me to design and develop their new business website, and career portal, to help HR department in intensive recruitment.

Developing with Perch CMS  helped me building a custom web portal, that is pleasing for the visitors, and is easy to manage for the company''s content managers and HR department.'
