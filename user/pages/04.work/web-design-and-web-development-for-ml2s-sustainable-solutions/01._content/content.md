ML2S Sustainable Solutions is a company providing consultancy and design services for sustainable developments and fit-outs, with a focus on green certificates. They hired me to design and develop their responsive website with Perch CMS for editing. I used their logo and brand colours as a starting point, and extended the visual identity with moving forms and typography to effectively communicate what they do. Developing with Perch CMS helped me creating a content management experience, that makes it easy to edit and update content without worrying about braking visual details.
