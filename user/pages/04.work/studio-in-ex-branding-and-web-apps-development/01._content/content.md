I started working on the systematic development of STUDIO IN-EX's corporate identity, and various interactive interfaces for internal and external communication in 2018. IN-EX is an architecture and engineering company specializing in effective design of large commercial and industrial buildings, leveraging BIM (Building Information Modeling). I've a long history with IN-EX – pre-university I worked there as an intern, and 2015-2016 I took part in company's re-branding, and interior design of the new office. 2018 I worked on refreshing all brand collaterals from logo to print materials. In-between the company grew from a small studio to a market leading, and industry-shaping international company, with more than 160 colleagues. During our long collaboration, I created numerous graphic materials and web applications for a wide variety of contexts and mediums. Among these, the graphic support for the company’s twenty-fifth anniversary, the design of corporate publications, and a bespoke career portal's design and development stand out.
