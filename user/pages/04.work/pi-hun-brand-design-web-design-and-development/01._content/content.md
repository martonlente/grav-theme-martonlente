PI-HUN is an architecture and engineering company located in Budapest, Hungary, providing complex design services of buildings and special structures, with decades of experience in designing cooling towers. They hired me to create a full rebranding of the company, to better reflect their activities and vision, and also to redesign and develop their website. The old logo had a cooling tower emblem: something we wanted to evoke semantically, but without illustrative elements. In the new logo design we ended up with a cheerful use of brackets: a typographic play, that evokes cooling tower silhouettes. At the same time being just a recognizable sign, it also works in different contexts. We designed and developed a website, that creates a space in that PI-HUN's building, and cooling tower designs are present equally, and strengthen each other.
