Living Budapest is a real estate agency in Hungary, assisting in renting, designing and selling properties. The agency's funder hired me to design the company's brand identity, and design and develop its web app where users can search for, and enquire about real estates. Our incentive was to create an identity that promotes a friendly way of living, while capturing a 'hygge' vibe: often in line with the agency's property offerings. I developed a custom web app running on PHP and Perch, that enables management of hundreds of apartments with filtering, location, and search services.
