A2B studio and KÓKAI TERV are prospering, youth interior design studios from Budapest, Hungary. They hired me to create high quality interior 3D visualizations of their restaurant project 'La Nonna' at Hévíz, Hungary, they designed in collaboration. Our intention was to capture the unique atmosphere of the space, that combines traditional 'Ristorante' feel with a twist of fresh design.
