Studio storiz is an interdisciplinary design studio in Budapest, Hungary, funded by Katalin Imre and Blanka Zvolenszki. They made their simple, yet beautiful website screen designs, which together we extended to a responsive design system, that works well on all devices. I made bespoke web development of all pages, and also integrated Perch CMS for a unique, and easy content editing experience.
