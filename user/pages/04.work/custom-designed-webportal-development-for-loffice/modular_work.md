    description: 'Loffice is a high-end, Budapest and Vienna based provider of coworking, coliving, and office rental services. Developing Loffice website and web application wasn''t only special because I started the project while working from the coworking space, but because I worked as part of a team of friends, and at the same time a very professional, creative one. My task was to develop Loffice''s website accordingly to the designs of Willem van de Ven, the animations of Noémi Barkoczi, and the ideas of Zsófi Énekes with very flexible Perch CMS integration. Together with Marcell Kovács back-end developer''s contribution we also integrated a dedicated SaaS solution through its API to the platform, that helps Loffice team managing enquires and office tasks more efficiently.'
