Marieke Elzerman is an emerging and talented filmmaker from the Netherlands. She needed a personal website that introduces her and her artwork. Willem van de Ven has designed a simple, yet beautiful design system for the web that playfully appear a bit different on each pageload. Based on the bespoke graphic designs, we developed a website that nicely aligns with the artistâ€™s human and professional self.
