László Nagy is a HR professional from Budapest, Hungary. Leveraging his many years of experience, he decided to start a web project called ComeOutTriumphant.org, that helps and trains people manage though work sitautions better, by combining professional advice with appropriate movie scenes. We made a digital product, that may not only be valuable to many – whether an inferior, a peer or a boss, but also entertaining.
