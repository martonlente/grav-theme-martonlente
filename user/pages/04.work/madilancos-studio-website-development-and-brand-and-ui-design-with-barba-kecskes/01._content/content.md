MádiLáncos Studio is a multi-award winning interior design studio in Budapest, Hungary, primarily recognized for providing state of the art office interior design services. Studio founders Krisztina Mádi, Áron Láncos, and partner János Szlovák hired my team to design the company's rebranding, and redesign- and develop its website. Based on conversations and research, together with graphic designer Barba Kecskés's logo and brand design, we realized a full rebranding and website redesign, that roots in MLS's history, yet captures the company's progressive design commitment, and vision. The fully bespoke website is one of the first projects built on Baseutil CSS, my own open-sourced CSS framework.
