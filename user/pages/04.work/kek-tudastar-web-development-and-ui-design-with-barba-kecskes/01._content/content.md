Kortárs Építészeti Központ (Contemporary Architecture Center Budapest) is a fundation of professionals and volunteers, managing, organizing and researching architecture-related initiatives. They hired my team to design and develop KÉK Tudástár (Knowledgebase), an organized web platform for browsing, reading and researching the fundation's library, and publications. Together with my partner, graphic designer Barba Kecskés we created a web UI that builds and extends KÉK's brand identity, while providing a pleasant UX for users searching in KÉK's huge database, or immersing themselves in reading of the fundation's beautiful publications and library material.
