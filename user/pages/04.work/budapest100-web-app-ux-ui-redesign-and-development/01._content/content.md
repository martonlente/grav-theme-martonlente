We first worked with KÉK - Contemporary Architecture Center in 2021 on the KÉK Tudástár (knowledgebase) web application. Following the successful project, in 2022 they commissioned us to completely redesign and develop the UX/UI of the KÉK Budapest100 architectural-cultural festival web application. In 2022, together with the KÉK team, I had a serious UX challenge to design an interactive map for a multi-thousand-item house database, as well as a multi-hundred-item online program list, and registration process. The visual part of the project involved the graphic design of the festival's online appearance, and developing its design system. I implemented the full-stack development of the web application based on the UI designs in 2023 with the contribution of Marcell Kovács. Programming challenges included working with an inherited million-item WordPress database, creating custom interactive features, and developing a back-end system that could accommodate thousands of registrations in a short time. The project combined graphic design, high-level full-stack development and IT challenges, an enthusiastic, inspiring team, and a common good cause - everything that is important to me.
