BIMCAP is a building information modeling company, with headquarters in the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and Hungary. They hired me to design their logo, business cards, stationery â€“ letterhead, and email signatures, as well as design and develop their responsive website with Perch CMS for editing. I emphasized the information-driven nature of architecture, paired with precision modeling, BIMCAP does throughout the identity.
