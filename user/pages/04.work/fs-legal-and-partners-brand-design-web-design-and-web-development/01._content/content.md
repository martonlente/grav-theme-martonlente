FS Legal & Partners is  a law firm in Budapest, funded by Dr. Zsuzsanna Farkas-Szabó, and Dr. Henrik Olivér Serfőző. Zsuzsanna hired me to design FS Legal's brand identity, including logo and stationary, and to design and develop their website. We went for a conservative and simple aesthetic, that paired well with the already-established, characteristic office interior. Designing the website was a collaborative, smooth process, and developing with Perch helped me creating  a content management solution fully unique to the company's communication needs.
