I started my business 2016, providing design and web development services. My intention with my brand design and website was to showcase my fields of activity, as well as give context to their connection. At the beginning, while displaying even more areas of activity, my goal was to visually unify and arrange them into a mutually reinforcing unity. This aspiration is reflected in the logo and all materials related to the brand. Therefore, it was particularly important to create a simple but effective typographic system for my work, primarily but not exclusively for the web. In 2021, I started to significantly simplify my own website and areas of activity, which I plan to continue shortly.
