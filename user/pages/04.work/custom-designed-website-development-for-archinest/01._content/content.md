ArchiNEST is a leading Hungarian architectural and engineering studio with large theatre, residential, industrial, and other public building design projects. They hired me for visual supervision of their business website's high-fidelity UX designs made in-house, and also its creative bespoke web development. I have integrated Perch CMS into their website, developing a unique, and easy content editing experience.
