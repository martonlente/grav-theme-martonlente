Ferenc Schüller is an outstanding Hungarian architect and designer, who runs a small studio called SCHÜLLER ÉS TÁRSAI (Schüller and Partners) for architectural, interior and object design. Together with Ferenc, and graphic designer Márton Pattantyús our goal was to design and build a website, that promotes the integrity and singular nature of the various activity fields, and also the high quality of the works presented. I built the front-end, and integrated Perch CMS into the website, developing a unique, and easy content editing experience.
