I have been doing architectural visualization since 2009. From 2014 to 2019, I worked on several architecture and design visualization projects together with various designers. I have selected some images below that I created during this period. The imagesâ€™ technical background varies as they were created with one of the three major, complex visualization platforms (3ds Max, Blender or Cinema 4D) that I explored and used during these years. Since 2017, I have led visualization training courses on all of these software platforms for visual professionals and have participated in developing their curriculum. Since 2019, I have been mostly involved in following and teaching the field as well as writing professional articles when the opportunity arises.
