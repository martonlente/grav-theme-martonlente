### Volunteer computing
Although I work alone in my business, due to the high hardware requirements of 3D visualization, my hardware equipment is equivalent to an average small business's of 8-10 people. Out of office time, I donate the hardware resources of my devices to the 'Mapping Cancer Markers' cancer research project on the 'IBM World Community Grid' volunteer network. I am currently owning 'Sapphire' badge, with more than thirteen years of computation time given.
