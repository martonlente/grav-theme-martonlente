### Responsible business operator
From the beginnings, I strive for maximum transparency, and the most ethical business conduct in my business. I am proud to do my job with legal, licensed software and assets in one hundred percent. Since 2020 I have been preferring to work with free and open-source software in all creative projects, when I have the opportunity.
