### Open-source
In 2020, I started relying more on Bash and command-line tools in my development projects and noticed that a huge part of my tools were already open-source. This year, [open-source became an important part of my activity,](/blog/introducing-an-open-source-creative-software-ecosystem-for-professional-graphic-design-on-linux-part-1) and with a lot of research and experimentation, I slowly rebased almost all my processes to open-source software solutions. For me, preferring open-source is an ethical choice that I strongly believe is the right way to create and work.

In 2021, I started contributing to open-source projects and creating public repositories that help other designers and developers work more efficiently on my [GitHub.](https://github.com/martonlente)

Iâ€™m the author of [Baseutil CSS,](https://github.com/martonlente/baseutil-css) an open-source, modern, fully flexible, and utility-centric desktop-first front-end framework designed to help developers in streamlined custom web development. I base all development projects on this to deliver unique designs in code with maximum efficiency.
