### Personal
I live on the edge of design and technology. I enjoy monitoring their matching evolvement, being part of it, and feeling their good impact on our daily lives. I'm grateful for the interesting times we live in.

Recently I'm very interested in human biology, and psychology sciences. I like spending my free time reading textbooks on the subject. I really welcome projects, that have to do something with the latter!
