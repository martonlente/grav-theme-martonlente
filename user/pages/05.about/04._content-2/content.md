### My story
I have significant bias to architecture in my family, which formed my interests and studies from day one. I was listening to conversations on architecture from childhood, but my interest aroused from not the design, but the presentation side. I was amazed by architectural visualizations of unbuilt designs.

I started architectural visualization in secondary school, 2007. After graduation, I had the opportunity to work as an intern at [STUDIO IN-EX Zrt.,](https://in-ex.hu/en/) producing high-quality architectural visualization that time. A year later I started studying at [Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design](https://mome.hu/en/) 2009.
I applied for MOME with the intention to understand architecture, and get better at communicating it. An art university better leveraged my interests because of its learning potential in adjacent fields, like graphic design and media. The flexible nature of its education, and its free, supportive atmosphere enabled me to learn from different sources too, and not stop working on exciting projects at different architectural studios along my studies.

School tasks and design contests were good for practicing visual communication, telling complex ideas in different ways. The breakout came 2014, when I established [LUMINOSE,](https://lumino.se) a lamp product with Elizabeth Zimmerer – my former university classmate – which enabled me to work through every stage of digital product development, from design to code. I further shifted my focus to brand, design and web development, based on the great experience and international exposure we had with the project.

I started my own business 2016, based on university MA studies, work experience, and passion for doing what I love most on a daily basis. In the first years I primarily worked for architectural and design studios on various brands, design and web development projects. I look forward to the next years with a lot of curiosity, and openness!
