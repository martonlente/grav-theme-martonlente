### Personal
I live on the intersection of design and technology. I enjoy monitoring their matching evolvement, being part of it, and feeling their good impact on our daily lives. I'm grateful for the interesting times we live in.

As well as my continous focus on architecture- and culture-related initiatives, recently I'm very interested in open-source design. I like spending my free time learning on the subject, and contributing to, or creating projects on a voluntary basis. I really welcome projects, that have to do something with the latter!

I'm a competitive amateur athlete, and I enjoy taking part in running competitions a couple of times per season, focusing on the 10K distance. My current training target is to run a sub-40-minutes 10K (improving my PB of 42:14 from 2022).
