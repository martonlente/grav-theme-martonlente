In next topics, we’ll focus on selecting most important computer components in arch-viz, starting with CPU and RAM, following up with GPU, and than with other parts. When it makes sense, we’ll take a quick look on consumer versus enterprise/professional solutions, as consumer choices are sometimes competitive options even in high-end professional segments. At last, we’ll briefly discuss different solutions in obtaining hardware, from building bespoke desktop solutions to selecting task-specific complete configurations/workstations.

### Selecting CPU for arch-viz

CPUs, or Central Processing Units are often referenced as the brain of the computer for a reason. For many years, all major render engines were CPU-based only, meaning, that selecting CPU was likely the most important choose in hardware selection, and – in mostly CPU based (e.g. in 3ds Max and Corona Renderer based) pipelines, still it is. **When speaking of CPU-based rendering, processors’ core frequency, and core count are the most important parameters.** Rendering utilizes all threads at maximum performance. However, from 3D applications’ performance, or GPU-based rendering point of view, processor’s single thread performance is what matters the most. In latter scenarios, think of CPU’s single-thread performance as an enabler, rather than an accelerator. Processor must be ‘good enough’ to prepare and transmit data to the GPU quickly enough, to make the latter work at its maximum power, but – generally speaking – doesn’t have to do more than that.
