Gimp is designed for similar uses like Adobe Photoshop and Affinity Photo. Gimp works with all the important image formats, and opens PSD files (with some limitations). **The feature set covers a huge range of professional applications, however the lack of adjustment layers makes non-destructive editing hardly possible.** Non-destructive editing is the standard way of working for many professionals, which means Gimp can't be fully considered a true alternative to proprietary image editing software, that have clever features for this.
