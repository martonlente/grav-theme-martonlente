Gimp's UI was characterised by unusual floating panels for years, that wasn't common for many. The UI evolved a lot over the years, but doesn't follow conventions, so that users must re-learn a lot of tools that otherwise work very similar in other software (you can e.g. easily transition from Photoshop to Affinity Photo or vice versa with little effort – but not to Gimp). Still, Gimp is a powerful tool on its own, and probably the most complete image editing software for Linux.

### Open-source publication design software: Scribus
[Scribus](https://www.scribus.net) is an open-source, professional publication and layout design software, with a similar focus like Adobe InDesign and Affinity Publisher. Scribus can read all major image, and publication file formats, and can open and edit some vector formats, like SVG. Scribus's native file format is SVG-based, which means it's so open, that you can practically open, read and edit it in a text editor. In many areas, and for a lot of use cases **it's comparable to either Adobe InDesign or Affinity Publisher: Scribus offers good page management, serious typographic control, and tools for ultra-precise graphic design work – primarily for print.** Scribus doesn't have pixel units, but nothing prevents you from using it for digital layout design, until you use ppi values meaningfully.
