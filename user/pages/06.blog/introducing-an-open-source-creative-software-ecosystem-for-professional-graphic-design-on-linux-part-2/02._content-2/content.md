### Open-source vector design software: Inkscape
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) is the most mature open-source vector design tool, belonging to the same group of software as Adobe Illustrator or Affinity Designer. A major advantage of Inkscape is that its native file format is SVG, which means it joins into various workflows extremely well. **Inkscape's feature set is huge: its vector drawing tools are on par with Illustrator, though some advanced typography tools, like character and paragraph styles are missing.**
