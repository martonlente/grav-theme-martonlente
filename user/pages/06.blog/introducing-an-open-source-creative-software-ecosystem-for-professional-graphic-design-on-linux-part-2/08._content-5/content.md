Out of the box, Scribus's UI is very clean and simple: panels can be opened and closed from the menu, or by keybindings as needed. These panels can also be docked if preferred, making Scribus's look more similar to other DTP software. Scribus is Qt-based, which means some of its UI 'features', like dark theme etc. need some extra configuration steps on non-KDE desktop environments to work properly. It's worth noting, that series version 1.5 have some work-in-progress features, and as such, quite some bugs, so use it cautiously in production.
