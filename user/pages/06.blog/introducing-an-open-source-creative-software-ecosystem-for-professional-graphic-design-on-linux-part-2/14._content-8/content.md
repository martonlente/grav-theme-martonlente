There's a trend though that new-age creative software run on web technologies – as discussed above – so that they're platform-independent. These apps run perfectly on Linux too: good examples are Corel Vector, Figma etc. If you're e.g. a UI designer doing almost everything in Figma, then there's nothing against putting Linux as your primary operating system.

[In Part 1](/blog/introducing-an-open-source-creative-software-ecosystem-for-professional-graphic-design-on-linux-part-1) I introduced the idea of Linux as a platform for design, and in Part 2 I briefly described an open-source creative software ecosystem, and its individual apps. In the future I might write about each part in more detail. Until then, I encourage you to start considering **Linux for design: a highly liberating, beautifully designed, and inspiring virtual environment to work in as a creative professional.**
