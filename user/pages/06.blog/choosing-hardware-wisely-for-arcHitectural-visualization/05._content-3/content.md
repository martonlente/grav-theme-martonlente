Intel and AMD are the largest brands producing desktop microprocessors by far, competing within the same segments. In consumer or desktop segment – which I suggest for individuals or smaller studios to search within too – Intel used to dominate for many years. However, recent years’ AMD Ryzen product line became so efficient that it already clearly delivers better value per dollar in CPU rendering, and all heavily multi-threaded pipelines. On the other hand, Intel’s high-end consumer CPUs – members of i7 and i9 product line – are likely still better in single-core performance, which is central in accelerating GPU, as such, likely being superior in GPU-weighted, e.g. real-time rendering pipelines.
