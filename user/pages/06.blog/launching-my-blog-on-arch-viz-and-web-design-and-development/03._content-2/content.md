**On this blog I'll publish case studies, ideas, and insights into my workflow, that help me succeed architectural visualisation and web design- and development projects.** Knowing myself I couldn't keep up posting if I'd stick to a rigid content plan, so my posts may be only loosely related, and represent what currently interests me. At the same time, I hope you'll find the ones that may bring value to your business or workflow, such as I've learnt so much from reading blogs and ideas of people with similar interest too.
