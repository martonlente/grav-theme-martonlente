My name is Márton Lente, I live in Budapest, Hungary, and currently work on design, and web development projects at LOFFICE, a coworking place.

### Serving architecture and design with representation

It all started with an interest in artistic representation of architecture. During my university years as an architectural artist student, I ended up doing two separate fields of activities, **architectural visualization, and web design- and development. 2016 I started my own business providing these services – primarily for architectural and design offices of small to medium sizes.** Finding a connection between arch-viz and web development may not be self-explanatory. Both visualization, and web development are about giving life to designs, whether it's a layout plan, or a UX/UI design. In such a way, both a visualizer, and a web developer is an end-role in a creative production process, whether the final product is an image, or a website.
