### Discussing hardware and software aspects of arch-viz

Architectural visualization is a creative field, where hardware and software go hand in hand. Still, after at least 30 years of continuous development and research, in arch-viz, hardware is still a major limit to what you can achieve within a given time. The limit can be pushed farther by experience and expertise, apart from buying new hardware. **On this blog I’ll share some of the key, lesser-known insights primarily on hardware, and software I came across over the more than ten years I’ve spent within the field, which I hope may bring as much value to your decisions or workflow as it brings to mine.** I’ll primarily focus on technical, and ’learnable’ aspects of architectural visualization, I so much like to discuss and talk about.
