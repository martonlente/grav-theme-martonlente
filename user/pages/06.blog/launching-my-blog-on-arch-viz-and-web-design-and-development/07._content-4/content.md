### Sharing front-end, and Perch CMS development tools and techniques

Custom web development of websites, webportals and webshops is becoming a speciality these days, with so much alternatives for small to medium businesses to create their websites, from online services with excellent UX, to a shear amount of WordPress themes. However, there's always room for state of the art custom website UIs, and bespoke web solutions, driven by business objectives. Also personal forces to create something unique, and stand out on the web will stay with us. **On this blog, I'll also write about front-end development tools and techniques, as well as Perch CMS that I use as a development tool to deliver highly custom web solutions to my clients.**

Please don't hesitate to comment the post, or email me, if you've an idea or question about the topic! Occasionally I also lead workshops on architectural visualisation in Budapest - in the most fortunate case we may consult the topic further live.
