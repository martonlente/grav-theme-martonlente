Professional work of any kind isn't possible without productivity tools, that we use to organize ourselfes and collaborate with others. **As designers, we often need the same communication tools that our clients and partners have in order to be able to align with their workflows.** Luckily, modern communication and project management software are often based on web technologies, so that also are platform-independent: we can keep in touch on Google Meets, Slack, Teams etc. or join virtual teams on Bitrix, Jira, Microsoft 365 etc. on Linux too. Keep in mind, that screen-sharing features of many productivity apps are only compatible with the X Window System, and not with Wayland yet – but it'll likely change soon.

Linux also excels, and – and in my oppinion – outperforms the latter in many low-level areas like file management, that make you more productive. Let's go [to Part 2](/blog/introducing-an-open-source-creative-software-ecosystem-for-professional-graphic-design-on-linux-part-2) to introduce the individual apps we can actually design with on Linux!
