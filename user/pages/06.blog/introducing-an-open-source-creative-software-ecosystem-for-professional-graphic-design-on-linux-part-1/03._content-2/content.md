### Essential tools of a digital designer: operating system and creative software
All digital designers using a computer need an operating system, which is usually either macOS, or Windows. MacOS is more popular among designers for historical, and other e.g. aesthetic reasons. Long ago it was common that creative software were only available for Mac, (which is much less frequent, but exists today – e.g. Sketch). **These days though,the two OSs are on par for design work,** and the choice is primarily a question of personal preference, or in some cases the availability of the very specific creative software you need.

Designers use creative software on their machines, which come either as part of full-featured creative suites, or individual tools for specific use cases. As well as the actual creative packages, there also are low-level and utility tools that help designers in their design workflow – like drivers and font managers.

### Overviewing creative software categories: vector design, image editing, publication design and UX/UI design
We could categorize creative software lots of different ways, but there're few broad categories we can safely define. Though necessarily, there're some overlapping features, **many software vendors target these distinct categories** – which will be the focus of my writing:
- Vector design (e.g. Adobe Illustrator, Affinity Designer)
- Image editing (e.g. Adobe Photoshop, Affinity Photo)
- Publication design (e.g. Adobe InDesign, Affinity Publisher)
- UX/UI design (e.g. Adobe XD, Figma, Sketch)

3D modeling suites form a different software category on their own, being used in so many industries for a lot of different applications. However, we can also add them to the list, as many digital designers leverage 3D software in graphic design projects.

The list could go further, but the above categories already cover a huge part of creative applications from logo design and illustration through photo editing, from magazine design, to app- and web design, as well as 3D graphics and animation.

### Overviewing proprietary creative software ecosystems: Adobe, Affinity and Corel
In order to put open-source design software into context, we must have a look on what proprietary creative software ecosystems are. The big creative software vendors develop complex software packages, that enable individuals, and different groups of creative professionals to efficiently work together across disciplines. For example, Adobe Photoshop is a powerful software on its own, but is also part of Adobe Creative Cloud sometimes just being one program used of the many in a bigger production. E.g. in a publication design workflow, Photoshop might be used for image editing, and InDesign for organizing the layout (even though software have some overlapping features, they're designed to excel in one specific area). Software within an ecosystem not only cover a more complete feature set, but are designed to work seamlessly together in a production. Some popular software ecosystem vendors are:
1. Adobe
2. Affinity
3. Corel

3D applications are often part of different, not creative, but engineering software ecosystems, though collaboration tools exist to integrate them into creative pipelines. (Think of e.g. Adobe After Effects and Maxon Cinema 4D Lite.)

Due to the distributed nature of open-source teams, it's harder to think of creative software ecosystems in free software context. Popular creative software are huge projects on their own, with challenging organisational tasks. Most programs follow open standards though, and the well-scoped feature set and use case of each **enable you to build a powerful production pipeline on them, comparable to proprietary suites.**
