As a result, if you confirm the above happens on your workstation, **having a more powerful video card won’t improve 3D viewport graphics performance at all.** In general, choosing even an entry-level gaming video card, like the current GeForce 1650, or its equivalent in future generations will maximize graphics performance in terms of most 3D applications’ viewport, even when paired with a high single-thread performance CPU. Until 3D software vendors can’t better optimize GPU utilization, the perceptions above remain true. All you can do to improve viewport speed is to change to a higher single-thread performance CPU, or better optimize your scene.

### Choosing an AMD or nVidia, consumer- or professional grade GPU for your workstation

**In terms of GPU vendors, choosing an AMD or nVidia graphics card, or – more generally – even a consumer-, or professional grade video card wouldn’t make much of a difference either.** However, new GPU-based innovations, if vendor-specific, will likely be compatible with your nVidia card only – like the nVidia OptiX denoiser – so that choosing an nVidia card may always be a safer option. As well, 2019 nVidia introduced ‘Creation Ready’, or ‘Studio’ drivers, so that 3D-software specific optimization is now available for consumer-grade GeForce line-up too, for a great value.

### Taking advantage of highest possible GPU performance in GPU-based rendering, as an exception

In specific cases, especially if you not only use your GPU to navigate your 3D viewport, **but for rendering too, you will of course greatly benefit from buying the most powerful video card you can get, whether it’s a consumer, or a professional-grade product.** GPU renderers are built to utilize the video card at 100 percent, and require much less CPU power to run the process. If you use software that utilize CPU for rendering though, like Corona Renderer or V-Ray, GPU is of secondary importance in your professional work.
