Video card or GPU is essential hardware in high-end architectural visualization work. However, having a more powerful video card in most cases doesn’t result in better graphics performance, or higher FPS rates in the given professional 3D softwares’, like 3ds Max’s or Cinema 4D’s viewport. **My perceptions below may help you better understand how your computer navigates the 3D viewport by using both the CPU and the GPU, and as a result, making wiser decisions when choosing a video card for your desktop or workstation.** The perceptions below apply to 3dsMax and Cinema 4D, softwares I’ve been using for many years, however likely are true for other professional 3D applications, like Blender, etc. Please note, that my suggestions assume you use a CPU-based renderer like Corona Renderer or V-Ray, and not a GPU-based renderer like Octane Render or Unreal Engine.
