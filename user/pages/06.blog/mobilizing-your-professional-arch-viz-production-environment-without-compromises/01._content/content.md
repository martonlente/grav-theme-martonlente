I do professional architectural visualization in a solopreneurship, with a rather conventional business-location setup, meaning I work on a desktop workstation from a coworking place in business hours, and on a laptop when outside of office. Working on arch-viz projects remotely, may not only be a must for whatever reason, but a luxury a lot of arch-viz artists may benefit from. **Having both a desktop workstation for maximum performance, and a laptop for flexibility brings a lot of difficulties to your workflow though.** Overcoming difficulties by developing an efficient workflow I set up a fully mobilized architectural visualization production environment, with no, or very little compromise, I think is worth sharing below.

### High-end laptops lag behind their desktop workstation counterparts significantly

2019 in business, having a laptop only even in creative fields is absolutely a valid option. **Many freelancers and small to medium size creative studios choose to have fifteen-inch powerful mobile workstations, and large external displays only, screen real estate being the only true limiter on productivity. High-end arch-viz isn’t like this though, primarily because of computing-intensiveness of rendering.** Whether CPU- or GPU based, rendering puts a serious thermal load on your machine, that’s much easier to manage and cool in large, than small. A high-end workstation class laptop CPU, e.g. an i7-9750H may have roughly one-third the performance of even a consumer class high-end desktop CPU, e.g. a Ryzen 9 3900X, or its equivalents in future generations. Speaking of dual Xeon setups, the three fold or bigger performance difference doubles up. Without tricky setups (see below) and special cases replacing your weighty desktop workstation with one laptop is likely still not a productive option just yet.
