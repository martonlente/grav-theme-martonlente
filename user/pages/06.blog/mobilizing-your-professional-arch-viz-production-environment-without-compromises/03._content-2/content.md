### Selecting hardware and tools wisely

Selecting hardware and tools will depend on the characteristics of specific software you use, however there’re some good rule of thumbs to follow. Selecting or building a workstation is out of scope of this article, but choosing a laptop is the more interesting part in terms of building a mobile arch-viz production environment. **In general, you shouldn’t chase to match the performance of your desktop workstation,** since laptops aren’t designed for that, but still you’ you should have solid performance in most tasks you use your workstation for. Choosing a laptop with the best consumer processor available usually has good price and performance ratio, which is key if you think of your laptop as your secondary machine. When upgrading your laptop for better CPU performance, look for core-count, and not only generation changes. Core-count increases will likely deliver much more performance gain, like we saw the jump from seventh to eighth generation i7 CPUs, but not from eighth to ninth etc. Matching the RAM size with your desktop workstation is also a good idea, to avoid unexpected problems in your workflow.
