### Building a website from the ground up, not vice versa

Since **Perch doesn’t come with themes, or any sort of code or visual elements that may be part of the output, you always need a professional to design and build your site.** This means, a Perch website may be just, and exactly as good as your visual designer, and developer, and even the admin interface will be built around- and for your content. On the other hand, a general WordPress workflow starts with having a complete blog or website, and then cleaning out the features like plugins, and styling like themes irrelevant to your needs. Even if there’re simple themes designed to be customized, WordPress’s workflow is the opposite to Perch’s, and how designers and developers think, being much less streamlined for custom outcomes.
