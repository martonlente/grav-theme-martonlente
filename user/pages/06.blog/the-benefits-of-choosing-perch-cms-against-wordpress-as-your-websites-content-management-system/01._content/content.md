In this post I’ll briefly introduce Perch CMS, a premium content management system, and how you may benefit from choosing it against WordPress for your website. There’s already a good [comparison between Perch and WordPress on Perch website,](https://grabaperch.com/vs/wordpress) but that’s primarily targeted at developers – I’ll instead focus on you, content editors here. If you’re a Perch developer, feel free to share this post with your present, or future clients.

Perch is a premium CMS, designed and developed by a UK-based developer couple, Rachel Andrew, and Drew McLellan – quite big names within the field. WordPress is a free, open source CMS, born of the discontinuation of b2/cafeblog blogging software.

### Managing content, against blogging

Perch was made with an entirely different purpose than WordPress, even though both software are called content management systems. **Perch was designed and built to be an optimal solution to deliver content management for bespoke small to medium websites,** with both static, and dynamic content. On the other hand, WordPress was made to be a feature-rich blogging tool, specifically for dynamic content. Since WordPress is free and open-source, a lot of developers have built plugins on top of the system, extending its functionality, making it capable to manage not just blogs, but all kinds of websites.

### Targeting professionals who build websites for others, for highest quality outcome

**Perch is primarily marketed for web professionals, and not content editors or end-users like you,** which may be one of the reasons you haven’t heard of it before. Web design and development professionals producing high quality web solutions choose Perch, to deliver the most optimal and easy editing experience for their clients, completely unique for their exact needs. On the other hand, WordPress is marketed both for developers and end-users. If you’ve enough time to educate yourself, you may launch a WordPress site with minimal to no developer help. Though in theory, you may be able to force WordPress to meet your website needs, the result will likely never be comparable to bespoke Perch website, hand-coded by a professional for you. Don’t forget there’re excellent WordPress developers too, who may help you with all kind of custom needs. However, achieving the same custom, yet simple outcome in WordPress may require much more developer effort, cost, and training time from your side.
