### Using Perch CMS and WordPress for what they’re designed to do best

Being a Perch developer myself, and having quite some successful Perch projects with satisfied clients, my opinions above may biased. **I’m not primarily a fan of Perch, but the workflow it suggests, which is so natural and streamlined to how professional designers and developers think and work when making web products.** To illustrate this, there’re other great CMSs with a Perch-like mindset, like Craft CMS, Kirby, Statamic, and Vapid, to name few. You unlikely to go wrong by choosing a professional who works with any of these. Don’t forget there’re also great WordPress developers, who will tell you why there’re no limits on what can be achieved on that platform. I myself also use WordPress for website projects on a tighter budget or schedule, for plugin-based website building, or light to medium theme-customization, where I think WordPress really shines. In such cases, I also dedicate much more time to train my clients using the CMS, after deploying the website though.
