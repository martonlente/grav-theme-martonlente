2018 I had the opportunity to work on web design and development of career portal and new business website of STUDIO IN-EX Zrt. IN-EX is an architecture and engineering company specializing in effective design of large commercial and industrial buildings, leveraging BIM (Building Information Modeling). I've a long history with IN-EX â€“ pre-university I worked there as an intern, and 2015-2016 I took part in company's re-branding, and interior design of the new office. 2018 I worked on refreshing all brand collaterals from logo to print materials. In-between the company grew from a small studio to a market leading, and industry-shaping international company, with more than 160 colleagues. **The project was an inspiring challenge, both in terms of web design and development, paired with an ideal and smooth workflow,** I'll share in two parts, starting with design below, and then following with development.
