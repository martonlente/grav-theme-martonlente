We defined the career portal's and business website's target audiences, and the different use cases how the sites may be used. After considering integration of career portal to business website, we decided to separate the two, because of their different target audiences and uses, while keeping a central content management interface for the maintenance advantages.

### Scoping features for the career portal

Intensive consultations and collaboration with internal and external experts started with finding and filtering the features the career portal needed from the inside and out. **The personal meetings accompanied the five-month process, with at least weekly frequency.** Based on Mariann Margl’s external HR professional’s and Vera Molnár’s STUDIO IN-EX’s dedicated specialist's guidance we defined a feature set, that was unique to IN-EX’s specific needs. Designing the web platform was tricky, because it had to fulfil triple aspects:
* The career portal had to clearly communicate the values of the company, both to regular visitors and job applicants.
* The portal had to be perfectly manageable by HR, with the justifiable level of flexibility, and most minimal prone to error, even when being edited by more colleagues.
* All applicants had to be able to easily apply for a job, along perfect error handling, and maximum protection of personal data.

### Planning content for the business website

A key selling point of STUDIO IN-EX's services is the 'closed-BIM' based workflow, the company has built over the years. It leverages the potential of having professionals from many fields of the whole building design process, and cutting-edge technology under one roof, resulting in a much more optimized building execution phase. Given that the company, and the technology itself is pioneering, we focused on educating visitors, and showing the benefits of working with IN-EX. We also wanted to give insight into company's atmosphere, which still has the homelike characteristics of studio's early days, empowering colleagues to talk, and share ideas.

### Starting the visual design process with wireframing

We assumed most visitors might look and apply for career opportunities, or browse the company's services primarily from their desktop or laptop, the sites also had to perfectly work on devices with all kinds of other devices, with 100 percent feature parity on each. We created a sitemap, defining all necessary screens, creating a natural flow of browsing the sites, and applying for a job. Then, after defining all necessary pages, I made wireframes of all screens, to explore most efficient layout of elements, for good UX both on desktop and mobile. **Starting design with wireframing helped us experience the large amount of data we had to work with, especially the more than a hundred input fields of the main application form.** The UX design process was also supported by Manuéla Szabó's supervision, from Vidu Media Kft.
