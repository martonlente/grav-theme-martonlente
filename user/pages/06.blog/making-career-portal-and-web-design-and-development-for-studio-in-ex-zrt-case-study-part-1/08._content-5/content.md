### Making the visual design

After everything found its place on the screen, and the website had an organized structure, I developed a visual look, building on the solid brand elements, that were re-designed earlier, the same year. I worked towards a UI, that works well for both the career portal and business website, and aligns with IN-EX’s efficient and straightforward mindset. Since the office space was just finished recently, I used extensive imagery showing it in use, giving insight into studio’s everydays. **Building on the studio interior’s communicative value, I defined a simple, minimalistic UI, through that images shine.** Some of the photos were exclusively shot for use on the website, by Vidu Media. I applied a component-based visual design approach, which I can consistently and easily extend or scale as the website grows.
