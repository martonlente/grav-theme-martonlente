### Growing need for a bespoke career portal and new business website

2017 IN-EX started an intensive recruitment strategy, to support the growing number of projects. Since advertising on SaaS recruitment platforms was costly, and limited, investing in a bespoke career portal solution made sense. Having one central platform only to advertise open positions and receive applications was also needed. The portal also had to enforce employer branding by communicating the very professional, yet friendly atmosphere IN-EX has. 2018 a full business website re-design was also actual, so that designing and developing both the career portal and the business website at a time was practical.
