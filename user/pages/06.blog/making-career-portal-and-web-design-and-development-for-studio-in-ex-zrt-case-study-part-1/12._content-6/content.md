I designed all screens for desktop and mobile screen sizes, to ensure a good base for custom development. **The component-based visual approach secured flexibility in advance, so that development shouldn’t be pulled back as new needs arose.** Designing and logically arranging the content editing interface was also ensured by defining content relationship between pages in advance. Choosing the professional Perch CMS as our content management system – a tool that enables bespoke creation of websites’ admin – supported me to develop an editing experience, that enables contents editors to fully manage the website, even with minimal or no training involved, and non-existent prone to error.
