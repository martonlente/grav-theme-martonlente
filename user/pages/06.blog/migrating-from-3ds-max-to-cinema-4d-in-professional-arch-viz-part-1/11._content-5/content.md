### Bringing your 3ds Max-based arch-viz workflow to Cinema 4D

The number of ways how you can use 3ds Max for architectural visualization efficiently is endless. Arch-viz professionals build different 3ds Max workflows, based on the specifics of their niche, the size of their team, etc. **The workflow-flexibility isn’t specific to 3ds Max though, Cinema 4D (and other 3D software in general) providing so many different ways to be used for arch-viz.** However, there’re some important differences to note if you plan migrating from 3ds Max to Cinema 4D.

Even though 3ds Max is a capable application, when it comes to arch-viz, you’ll find it does lack some rather basic features by default. Chances are, you aren’t aware of this, since **by using third-party plugins and scripts, all sorts of basic, and hugely specific features can be easily added, making up for the shortcomings.** Think about Soulburn Scripts – a script package containing basic actions – that lots of arch-viz artists hugely depend on in their workflows. Or missing advanced scattering tools for adding repetition, like the third-party Forest Pack, or scattering solutions coming with external renderers (e.g. Corona Scatter). Without these tools 3ds Max is basically doomed.
