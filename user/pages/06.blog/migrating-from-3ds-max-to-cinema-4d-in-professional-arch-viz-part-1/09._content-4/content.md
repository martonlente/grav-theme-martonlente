Migrating from 3ds Max to Cinema 4D is the easier learning path to take, when compared to vice-versa. Supported by knowing what you’re looking for, you’ll go from the more complicated software to the less. **When having a solid knowledge of 3ds Max, and learning Cinema 4D, it’s a good practice to search for similarities, and mindfully notice differences.** Without going into detail with each, I’m listing some major examples:
* 3ds Max has five poly sub-object levels (Vertex, Edge, Border, Polygon, Element), while Cinema 4D only has three (Points, Edges, Polygons).
* 3ds Max has a linear Modifier Stack, while Cinema 4D has Generators, Modeling, and Deformer commands (objects), that has a meaningful hierarchical arrangement.
* 3ds Max has Isolate Selection, Cinema 4D has Viewport Solo modes.
* Both software has a Layers Manager. However, in 3ds Max it’s likely more important, being the primary way to organize your entities. Cleverly using Cinema 4D’s Object Manager already gives a logical structure to your scene, leaving the use of Layers Manager somewhat optional. Many arch-viz studios work by ignoring Layers Manager in Cinema 4D altogether.
* In 3ds Max lots of object properties are basically visually hidden on the UI. Not in Cinema 4D, where most object properties can be added visually, by the corresponding Tags.
* In polygon modeling, 3ds Max can be used to model completely ‘non-destructively’, by extensive stacking of ‘Edit Poly’ modifier. Not with Cinema 4D, where – ‘Edit Poly’s’ alternative – the Correction Deformer is limited to basic commands without poly-count change.
* 3ds Max has Multi/Sub-Object Materials and Material IDs for poly-level material assignment, while Cinema 4D has Selection Tags.

### Comparing 3ds Max and Cinema 4D’s user interface for arch-viz use

3ds Max is often criticized for its bloated and rigid user interface, that hasn’t changed a lot over the many years of its development. 3D artists learn where to look for fundamental commands by training and practice, rather than intuition. The user interface is somewhat fragmented into lots of different panels and popups, often overflowing your display, making it hard to find what you’re looking for. **Autodesk** – being aware of this – **puts a lot of effort to improve 3ds Max’s UX and UI, user interface changes being fundamental selling points of recent years’ new releases.** Think about the ‘Ribbon’ with ‘Graphite Modeling Tools’ added some years ago, and the fully re-designed look and feel launched with version 2017.

Users find Cinema 4D easier to learn for a reason. **When compared to 3ds Max’s, Cinema 4D’s UI feels just friendlier, having less clutter on the screen at a time.** Almost all tools have a descriptive icon, making commands’ outcomes less abstract for beginners. The Object Manager shows a clear overview of your scene at all time, giving so many information at a glance. (It’s a good idea to use it intentionally though, and keep your hierarchies organized, otherwise it’ll go against you.) What I like most in Cinema 4D’s UI is that it operates with much less action-specific popups and windows than 3ds Max, using Attributes Manager with an extreme level of versatility, on a standardized manner. If you get a grip of it, all tools seem familiar even when using them the first time.
