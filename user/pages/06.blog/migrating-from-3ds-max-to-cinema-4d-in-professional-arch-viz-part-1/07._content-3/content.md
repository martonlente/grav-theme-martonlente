Cinema 4D’s beginnings also root back to the early 90’s. However, Cinema 4D’s predecessor, FastRay wasn’t a full-fledged 3D package, but rather a renderer. First versions of the software with a GUI were released only years later. **The more business-driven and careful development attitude helped defining stricter feature scopes, with a more designed progression from release to release.** Cinema 4D’s development is also characterized by a modular approach, meaning complex software components and feature sets can be detached or added to the software. This approach enabled Maxon to provide different versions of the software to different industries, which is – from September 2019 –  no longer the case.

Both 3ds Max and Cinema 4D has an ultra-wide feature set, with a significant overlap. However, both software also have their niche industries, where they’re extremely popular – e.g. video game artists prefer 3ds Max for its modeling tools, while motion graphics  artists often choose Cinema 4D instead primarily for its MoGraph module. **In case of arch-viz use, 3ds Max is more popular in most countries** – especially in areas where Autodesk software packages dominate in AEC. **Cinema 4D is often used in Western European countries though,** where use of Graphisoft ArchiCAD is common among architects and designers (ArchiCAD being owned also by Nemetschek, the company behind Maxon Cinema 4D).

### Comparing 3ds Max and Cinema 4D’s learning curve for arch-viz

Maybe because of how the software were designed and created in their early days (see above), 3ds Max is probably more difficult to learn on a professional level than it is to learn Cinema 4D. Many 3D artists – including myself – actually think, Cinema 4D is the easiest professional 3D application to get started with, because of its streamlined user interface, and more logical grouping of its features. What I especially like in Cinema 4D is, that just by studying UI you find almost all of its features usually paired with an icon, and there’s much less going on hidden, behind the scenes.
