Cinema 4D – having a smaller arch-viz user base – has consequentially much less high-quality third-party plugins. However – **as you start discovering Cinema 4D –, you’ll be surprised how much of 3ds Max’s missing arch-viz tools are present in just the core package.** Robust alignment, naming, object and scene management, as well as optimization tools are all there. When it comes to scattering, Cinema 4D has you covered with its award-winning MoGraph toolset. The software also has a highly usable 3D asset library for arch-viz, with detailed 3D models of architectural elements, furniture, props, and even sample scenes. A professional arch-viz workflow can be entirely based on Cinema 4D’s core features only, without literally using any third-party plugins (other than an external renderer). Relying on the core 3D software only comes with so many advantages – like the maintenance reliefs, the undependency and unspecificity of your scenes, and the portability of the tool itself.

### Summing up and introducing part two

3ds Max is still the most popular 3D application in professional arch-viz by far, and chances, are, you haven’t ever thought of trying something new, or migrating to a different software. However – for whatever reason – if you do so, **now may be a good time to experiment with, or migrate to Cinema 4D. The software has a smooth learning curve, a nice UX and UI, and a complete feature set for arch-viz without the need of third-party plugins.** Popular renderers in arch-viz – like Corona Renderer or V-Ray – are already available in their commercial versions for Cinema 4D too, with almost 100 percent feature parity to their 3ds Max counterparts.

I hope the above showed you a solid overview what it likes to migrate from 3ds Max to Cinema 4D, and gave courage and mood to try the former. In part two, I’ll go into more detail in comparing different parts of the workflow in 3ds Max and Cinema 4D – like modeling, shading, lighting, and rendering – and also have look on some other important aspects of doing arch-viz, like finding 3D assets for the software.
