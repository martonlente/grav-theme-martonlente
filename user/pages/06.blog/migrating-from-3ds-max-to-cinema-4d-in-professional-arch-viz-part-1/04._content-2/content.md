At the time I started migrating from 3ds Max to Cinema 4D, there weren’t many guidelines or opinions shared on the subject. Today I’m using Cinema 4D and Corona Renderer in all projects I’m working on, and couldn’t be more satisfied I made the change. **Whether I’m using 3ds Max or Cinema 4D, software puts no limit on the quality of my work.** I’m also running a Cinema 4D training for visualization with 3dhome, a Maxon-certified training institute in Budapest, Hungary. I’m sharing my experience on the migration process, that may help you evaluate if migrating from 3ds Max to Cinema 4D was also beneficial, and effort-worthy for your business.

### Comparing 3ds Max’s and Cinema 4D’s context of creation and use

Understanding how 3ds Max and Cinema 4D were designed and created may help us comparing their primary use cases, ease of use, and other important aspects.

3ds Max’s predecessor, the 3D Studio was released in 1990. The idea of creating 3ds Max (3D Studio) wasn’t primarily driven by business objectives at start, but rather the curiosity of some of its initial developers to make a more capable 3D animation software. Autodesk entered 3ds Max’s development quite early, but **the software’s progression was primarily dictated by its core developers’ ideas and experimentation in early days.** Adding features to the software was always, and still is somewhat organic, which resulted in an ultra-capable, yet bloated 3D package, used in so many industries. If you’re interested in software’s history, [you can read this interview with Tom Hudson,](https://cgpress.org/archives/cgarticles/the_history_of_3d_studio) one of 3ds Max’s initial main developers.
